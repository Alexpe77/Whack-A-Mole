# Whack-A-Mole game

This project is a whack a mole clone so mine is called *Whack a Diglett* and you'll see why at the end of this read me ðŸ˜„ </br>
So as you may know the goal of this traditional game is to prevent "moles" from coming out the ground with a hammer. </br>
Every second a new "mole" appears and you'll have to click on it to gently tell her to go back into the soil where it belongs. </br>
To use it you have to click on the start button and you're ready to go.

## Technology used

For this project I used time outs and intervals so there's JavaScript. </br>
But I also used HTML and SCSS.
